# javascriptForms
I took like 4 hours trying to begin this project but ended up earesing everything. Finally I was able to make things work. I had a problem with my submit buttom that took me an hour to figure out until sm√°ri ponted out I had ordered js to devalue it witch I hadn't noticed - so sometimes you just need another type of eyes to look over the code. 
I would say I learned a lot doing this project compared to how difficult js is for me.
